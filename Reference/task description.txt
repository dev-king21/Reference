1.
I can work full time until I finish your project.
I can finish your project 2 ~ 3 weeks.
2.
I saw your app prototype.
There are 119 screens in your app prototype.
And App Language is not english, so i need all native language text appeared in your app.

2.1 
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eatstreet.android&hl=en : this is small project with 12 screens, so it is taken about 10 days to develop and distribute.
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grabtaxi.passenger&hl=en : about 10 days.

and I have developed with multi platform vpn app and web apps - https://shenyeymz.com/, https://huanjingvpn.com
platform - windows, linux, macos, android, ios
but macos, ios version for this app is not allowed because my ADP(Apple Developer Program) account is individual one, so i can't distributed this app now. (about 2 months + 2 weeks)

2.2 
I need one month for finishing to develop this app at least.

3. 
I have developed vpn apps before.
This app developed by using of RESTful API and developed cooperatly with my colleague on github. 

4. At the stage of developing and distributing apps, i can prepare the document for you to maintain and upgrade this app.
And if you want anything more, I'll do this.

The project is quite large, so i'll consider budgetary issues.

Thank you so much for your attention.
